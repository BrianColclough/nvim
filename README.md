# nvim

This neovim config is created for my needs. It is always a work in progress as I understand neovim more.
The plugin manager being used is lazy.nvim, and I'm using mason.nvim to manage LSP servers. Which has made it
so much easier to manage LSP servers.


## Good Documentation for the different plugins
